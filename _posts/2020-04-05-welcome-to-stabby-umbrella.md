I've always liked the idea of blogging in theory and concept, and have equally always been poor in the execution. But none of the current fandom-y blog areas seem to suit _precisely_, and I want a place to crosspost some of my tumblr ramblings, as well as my longer-form fandom-and-life ramblings.

And then, y'know, we had a fucking plague, so this is also something of a plague-diary, since one can always aspire to be that one cheating copper merchant in ancient Sumer.

I'm going to post a few backdated entries I've been working on and/popped into my head and storing locally, cross-posting some of my longer-form entries from tumblr I want saved in a more convenient to find format, and other assorted rambles.

(And will use this as a code-sandbox for playing with Jekyll theming, because why not.)
