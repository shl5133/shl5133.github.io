I've always liked the idea of blogging in theory and concept, and have equally always been poor in the execution. And since drafts are where things go to die on tumblr, and also it's broken enough I can't easily find my own additions to reblogs, personal posts, etc, I want a place to crosspost some of my tumblr ramblings, as well as my longer-form fandom-and-life ramblings.

And then, y'know, we had a fucking plague, so this is also something of a plague-diary, since one can always aspire to be that one cheating copper merchant in ancient Babylon.

I'm (probably) going to post a few backdated entries I've been working on and/popped into my head and storing locally, cross-posting some of my longer-form entries from tumblr I want saved in a more convenient to find format, and other assorted rambles.

(And will be using this _lots_ as a code-sandbox for playing with Jekyll theming/GitHub Pages, because why not.)
